\vin \textit{A STUDY IN AN EMOTION}

"'Tis but a vague, invarious delight. \\
As gold that rains about some buried king.

As the fine flakes, \\
When tourists frolicking \\
Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light \\
Try photographs, wolf down their ale and cakes \\
And start to inspect some further pyramid;

As the fine dust, in the hid cell beneath \\
Their transitory step and merriment, \\
Drifts through the air, and the sarcophagus \\
Gains yet another crust \\
Of useless riches for the occupant, \\
So I, the fires that lit once my dreams \\
Now over and spent, \\
Lie dead within four walls \\
And so now love \\
Rains down and enriches some stiff case. \\
And strews a mind with precious metaphors,

And so the space \\
Of my still consciousness \\
Is full of gilded snow,

The which, no cat has eyes enough \\
To see the brightness of."

\end{verse}
